Differences between Alpha and Beta: In Alpha: the main functionality that we provided was integration with Facebook and Parse and providing the wireframes for all of our views.

In Beta: -The biggest difference is providing the user with the ability to Log in with Facebook and create a username. The username then gets stored in the Parse database. -We added the ability for users to create Battles/Competitions of their own, which is then synced up with parse and displayed in the Battle Table View Controller. 
-Users are able to enter any of these battles and start submitting pictures of their own to the Battle.
-The game is now fully playable, the phases of the battle change based on time

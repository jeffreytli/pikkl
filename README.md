> **Disclaimer:** This README is for a series of educational projects for CS378: iOS Mobile Computing at the University of Texas at Austin with Bob Seitsinger in semester Fall 2015. Our goal was to create an iOS application, a spin-off variation of the popular SnapChat application. 

# Getting Started
The following instructions fall under the assumption that you understand how to clone the repo and are able to run the application using an iOS device or a simulator. It should also be noted that this application requires the use of a Facebook account. In instances in which you don't have an account, a sample, dummy account has been provided.
* Log out of your Facebook account on your computer or mobile device. 
* Open Pikkl and login with the following Facebook credentials [This account is part of our FB Developer List]:
```
User: bobbysightsinger@gmail.com
Pass: bobbyisthebest
```

# The Game
The game is a photo taking competition played in 3 phases: Submit, Vote (Join), Final (Scores). The length of each of these phases fall under to possible categories, short and long, each with a pre-determined length.
* **Create:** All users will be routed to the initial page where they'll see a page of all of the current battles. In instances in which you want to create your own battle, simply hit the '+' button in the top right corner. Here, you'll be able to input the name of your battle or select from a set of randomly generated names (coming up with names can be hard!)
* **Submit:** Your battle is in the first phase, Submit. Click your battle to go the Submit screen. Tap the camera to add a photo from your library. Click the Submit button and the photo will be added to parse.
* **Vote:** Wait in the 'Battles' Table View and refresh until the VOTE phase is available (green 'Current Phase:' Vote). Tap your battle and tap on an entry to vote for it. Tap the entry to view and rate it with the slider (1-5 scale). Then tap 'Cast Vote'!
* **Final:** Wait in the 'Battles' Table View and refresh until the FINAL phase is available (green 'Current Phase:' Final). Tap your battle and see the final average scores. Tap a score to view the photo entry.

#Beta
* The biggest difference is providing the user with the ability to Log in with Facebook and create a username. The username then gets stored in the Parse database. 
* We added the ability for users to create Battles/Competitions of their own, which is then synced up with parse and displayed in the Battle Table View Controller. 
* Users are able to enter any of these battles and start submitting pictures of their own to the Battle.
* Battle objects and Battle entry objects have been created and populated with data
* Users can submit photos (which are stored in parse) to be voted on in battles
* User can vote on battle entries
* Users can see a final screen, where all of the average scores per photo are showed
* The game is now fully playable, the phases of the battle change based on time

#Beta - Contributions
Julio (33.333333%)
* did front-end (storyboard) and back-end programming for 'vote' and 'final' view controllers
* designed and created battle entry object in parse for keeping track of entries (created in submit view controller)
* implemented conditional segue for various stages in BattleTableViewController
* updated battle object to keep track of it's entries
* implemented the different phases of the battle along with their associated views within the story board
* implemented the logic for uploading, submitting and storing photos into Parse
* created voting system and updating of votes and average scores for final view

Jeffrey (33.333333%)
* implemented all of the infrastructure and code for time based change of phases
* implemented core data for saving all of the battles, used in displaying the initial battle table view
* added alert dialog in battle table view for additional confirmation of battle creation 
* added segue to return back to battle's list after battle creation
* implemented core logic for querying Parse for all Facebook friends (this is currently unimplemented in beta due to the time constraints)
* added refreshing capabilities on the battle table view for possible inconsistent states (multiple external users creating battles at the same time)
* allowed users to login with Facebook and create a username, which is stored in the Parse database.

Morgan (33.333333%)
* front end design changes: constraints, icons, typography, color
    - final hi-fidelity design will be implemented for Final Version
* UI/UX game redesign: 3 phase game system
* implemented slider for voting
* upload and image selector camera for submit - front end

# Final
* After a battle is completed, a user is able to selectively choose to download all of the images submitted for the battle or download individual submissions. These will be downloaded to the user's default Photo storage.
* Global competitions were successfully implemented. All application users will see and be a part of a global set of battles.
* Post game votes will reveal the winner of the competition along with the individual statistics for each submission including: the average number of votes, total number of votes, total number of voters, etc.
* Phase sorting was implemented. Now, the most recent battles will show up at the top of a user's list rather than being displayed randomly.
* Improved UI/UX
* As mentioned within the initial design documentation, we implemented a functionality in the Parse cloud database to selectively coose to remove competitions after 3 days. This script runs once per day at at 12am using the Parse Cloud Jobs tool.

# Final - Differences
Due to the dynamic nature of the game, using notification manager to notify users when theyâ€™ve been invited to a competition wasn't necessary because we decided it was best to just feature global games rather than friend-specific games. Users are not notified when a battle is about to end because we decided against running the app in background while it is closed.
 
# Final - Contributions
Julio
* Added logic for calculating and saving average scores for ordered parse query
* Implemented ordered (by final score) final table view controller with 2 different prototype cells
* Helped Jeffrey style UI based off design mock-ups
* Added Parse Cloud Code to delete 3 day old battles entries and battles from parse as per final version goal
* Added code to prevent users from voting on own entries and added activity indicators for loading images
* Re-did vote and final view controllers to contain table views, rather than be table view controllers

Jeffrey
* Added functionality to allow users to download all of the submissions within a battle
* Implemented the UI based off of design mock-ups/wireframes for all views
* Implemented sorting functionality for core data. Most recent battles are now displayed at the top of a user's list
* Implemented a random battles title generator. The Create page now displays a randomly selected set of titles/recommendations.
* Added logic for saving lower resolution photos (thumbnails) for faster querying/processing
* Fixed the time/phase interval logic
